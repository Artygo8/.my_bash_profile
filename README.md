# my_bash_profile
Useful functions that I use everyday.

## usage
Clone the repo inside your **home directory**, then launch the installation script.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Artygo8/.my_bash_profile.git && \
~/.my_bash_profile/install.sh
```
Note: You are invited to modify the aliasses since they are very personal

## utils
- [x] gitacp -- (pull), add, commit, push
- [x] kubepod -- get the full pod name

## aliasses
These are really personal, not very exportable yet.
