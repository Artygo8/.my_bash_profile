# my_bash_profile
Useful functions that I use everyday.

## usage
Its up to you ! Personally, I clone the repo into my home directory, then i edit the .profile (on macOS) and/or the .bashrc (works better on Linux) with the following lines, depending on what you need :
```bash
source ~/.my_bash_profile/utils.sh
source ~/.my_bash_profile/aliasses.sh
```

## utils
[x] gitacp -- (pull), add, commit, push -- arguments form the message, no need to use double quotes

## aliasses
These are really personnal, not very exportable yet.
