# my_bash_profile
Useful functions that I use everyday.

## usage
Its up to you ! Personally, I clone the repo into my home directory, then i edit the .profile (on macOS) and/or the .bashrc (works better on Linux) with the following :
```bash
source ~/.my_bash_profile/main.sh
```

## utils
[x] gitacp -- (pull), add, commit, push
[x] kubepod -- get the full pod name

## aliasses
These are really personnal, not very exportable yet.
